# Does democracy really enhance the quality of life?

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether democratic systems are genuinely superior to non-democratic ones, as often assumed. By comparing life quality, political stability, and aspects of living across both types of governance, including examples such as China, the project aims to determine which system provides better outcomes in terms of overall well-being.

## Introduction

Numerous young people and working-age individuals are increasingly advocating for rights, freedoms, and democracy, believing that these principles are key to building a better society and improving quality of life. We often look to countries like the USA, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where people enjoy a high standard of living, as benchmarks for what we aspire to achieve. Democratic values are frequently emphasized in various media, including films, shaping our perception that non-democratic systems—like dictatorships or communism—are inherently antagonistic to a good life.

However, it is crucial to recognize that not all developed countries operate under democratic systems. For instance, China, despite not being a democracy, has made significant strides in development and has elevated the living standards of millions of its citizens. This challenges the notion that democracy is the only path to achieving prosperity and underscores the importance of understanding the complexities and nuances of different governance systems.

# Objectives

- **Comparative Analysis:** To conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of democratic versus non-democratic systems concerning various dimensions of life quality, including economic stability, social welfare, health care, and education. The goal is to determine which system better supports overall well-being and citizen satisfaction.
- **Political Corruption:** To examine the relationship between political systems and levels of corruption. This includes assessing how different governance structures impact transparency, accountability, and the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures.
- **Case Studies and Best Practices:** To explore real-world case studies of both democratic and non-democratic countries, identifying best practices and successful strategies that contribute to higher quality of life and effective governance. This helps in understanding how different systems can adopt beneficial practices from one another.
- **Policy Recommendations:** To develop policy recommendations based on the findings, offering practical guidance for governments and policymakers on improving governance practices, enhancing transparency, and addressing key issues related to quality of life and corruption.
- **Educational Outreach:** To create educational materials and programs that inform the public about the nuances of different political systems and their impacts. This aims to foster a more informed citizenry capable of engaging in meaningful discussions about governance and its effects on society.
- **Aspects Understanding**: to understand both democracy and non-democracy systems to 

## Data Sources

This project utilizes data from various reputable sources, including:

- **[World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/):** Provides extensive datasets on economic indicators and social demographics, which are used to analyze global trends and patterns.

- **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/):** The primary dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It includes comprehensive information on life expectancy, mortality rates, healthcare expenditure, and various socioeconomic indicators across different countries and years.

- **[University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/project/research-themes/democracy-and-development/coup-detat-project/freq-table):** Offers a detailed frequency table of coup events worldwide from 1945 to 2023, providing critical insights into political instability and its impact on development.

## Methodology

Our approach involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from multiple sources, which are World Bank Open Data, Kaggle and University of Illinois Urbana Champaign,  ensuring completeness and accuracy.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values using machine learning technique, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing and summarizing the data to understand trends and relationships.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to identify significant factors contributing to the wealth gap.
5. **Recommendations**: Based on our analysis, proposing actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders.

## Analysis

This report evaluates the impact of democratic and non-democratic regimes on the quality of life and development. It examines various indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, access to electricity, and freedom indices to understand the correlation between governance systems and quality of life.

**Democratic vs. Non-Democratic Regimes:**

- **Decision-Making:** Non-democratic regimes often exhibit quick decision-making capabilities but may sacrifice individual freedoms and human rights. In contrast, democracies emphasize citizen participation and transparent decision-making processes.
- **Economic and Social Development:** Both systems can achieve economic growth, but democracies tend to foster more sustainable development through innovation and public engagement.
- **Stability and Governance:** Non-democratic regimes might provide stability and preserve traditional values, while democracies ensure accountability and lawful governance.

## Findings

1. **Quality of Life:** Developed countries, which are typically democratic, show better quality of life indicators, including higher GDP per capita and longer life expectancy.
2. **Freedom and Development:** There is a positive correlation between democracy and development. Countries with higher freedom scores generally have better life quality indicators.
3. **Economic Growth:** Non-democratic regimes like China demonstrate rapid economic growth, but this growth does not always equate to improved individual freedoms or overall life quality.
4. **Stability vs. Democracy:** While non-democratic regimes can offer stability, democratic countries show fewer instances of political instability and coups, contributing to long-term stability and development.

## Recommendations

1. **Support Democratic Processes:** Encourage democratic governance structures that ensure transparency, accountability, and citizen participation. This can lead to more sustainable development and improved quality of life.
2. **Promote Human Rights:** Uphold and protect human rights and freedoms as part of governance reforms. This enhances individual well-being and contributes to overall societal progress.
3. **Balance Rapid Growth with Inclusivity:** For non-democratic regimes, aim to balance rapid economic growth with inclusive policies that improve living standards and safeguard individual freedoms.
4. **Invest in Education and Infrastructure:** Both democratic and non-democratic regimes should focus on investing in education and infrastructure to drive economic development and improve quality of life.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that democratic regimes are generally more effective in improving quality of life and fostering development. Countries with democratic governance tend to achieve better life quality indicators, such as higher GDP per capita and longer life expectancy, due to their emphasis on transparency, accountability, and citizen involvement. While non-democratic regimes can achieve rapid economic growth and stability, they often lack the freedoms and human rights protections found in democracies. For sustainable development and improved quality of life, it is crucial to support democratic processes, protect human rights, and invest in education and infrastructure.
